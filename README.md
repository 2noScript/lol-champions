`This project is based on the creation of a website, whose main theme is the champions or characters, from the game League of Legends (LOL). In which you can see their different classifications, filters can be made on their positions, their attacks and their origins. At the same time, the Runeterra Map can be viewed, with the corresponding subdivision of the original towns of each champion. Each champion will have their biography, along with a detailed description of their attacks and their origin. You can also find a list of favorites, where you will find those that we have previously given ♥`
